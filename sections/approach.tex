As stated previously, we are planning to equip a number of test subjects with an Oculus Rift, and have them walk a path.
The first step for us, is to create a virtual world.
We need to bind the movements of the virtual world to the movements that the subjects make in real life.
This will most likely require us to program using an Oculus Rift SDK, with the added possibility for us to change the rotation ratio, i.e. the amount of real world rotation in comparison with the amount of virtual world rotation.

A test subject will attempt to follow a path, with a given rotation ratio.
Whilst running the test, the test conductor will actively follow and record the path the test subject has travelled in the real world. 
Some users (about half of our test group) will be asked to conduct a task while following a path, such as counting a number of objects in the world.
The other users will only walk the path.
We will experiment with different rotational gains e.g. +40, +50, +60 and +70\%, around the +68\% and +49\% reported by Steinicke et al.
We also reasearch the negative rotational gains in steps e.g. -30, -20, 019\%, again around the values reported by Steinicke et al.
