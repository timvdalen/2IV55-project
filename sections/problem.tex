Our research is about ``redirected walking", a technique to let users walk through a large virtual environment using a head mounted display (HMD).
We focus our research on rotational gains.
``Rotational gains cause a user's rate of rotation in virtual space to by either greater or less than 
the user's physical rotation. This can be applied when the user rotates his head or upper body 
without moving his legs, or when the user rotates by adjusting his footing. For example, if the 
user rotates 60 degrees in the real world, a rotational gain of 5/4 could be applied so that the 
user rotates 75 degrees in the virtual world."\cite{jwalker}

Our research question is: At what rotational gains does the user notice that the virtual world and the real world rotations are different? And is this number differenet when a user is engaged in a task versus when a user is just walking around without specific task? (other than walking around).
