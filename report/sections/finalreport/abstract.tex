This report described the course project for 2IV55 Interactive Virtual Environments in the academic year 2014-2015.
Virtual environment can be used in a number of settings including but not limited to gaming and safety training.
Redirected walking is the practice of falsely updating the virtual world with respect to the real world in order to redirect the wearer of the head mounted display (HMD).

In this report we describe an experiment to determine noticing thresholds of rotational gains.
Our test subjects do not walk in the real world while performing the experiment wearing an Oculus Rift HMD.
We find that negative rotational gains are noticed earlier than positive ones.
In addition, the process of designing and executing the experiment is described.
