%\subsection{Software Implementation|
To implement the world, we have edited the \textit{TinyRoom} sample included in the Oculus SDK. 
We multiply the input head yaw by a factor between 0,5 and 1,5.
We have not yet created our virtual environment, we are confident that we can do this in a relatively small amount of time because we do know how it should be done.
Also the implementation of the color-changing dot should be relatively straightforward using GL.

A big challenge yet to conquer is positional tracking.
The Oculus SDK 2 is equipped with a positional tracker but it seems not to be optimized for walking around in a room.
We have tried to overcome this problem by using Bluetooth triangulation, but it was too slow to be feasible.
