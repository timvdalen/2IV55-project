	At what rotational gains does the user notice that the virtual world and the real world rotations are different?
	
	\pause
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\fontsize{16pt}{7.2}\selectfont
	Is this number different when a user is engaged in a task?
	
	\note{
		We focus our research on rotational gains.
		
		Rotational gains cause a user's rate of rotation in virtual space to by either greater or less than the user's physical rotation.
		This can be applied when the user rotates his head or upper body without moving his legs, or when the user rotates by adjusting his footing.
		For example, if the user rotates 60 degrees in the real world, a rotational gain of 5/4 could be applied so that the user rotates 75 degrees in the virtual world.
		
		So the key virtual reality concept here is: When is the world no longer immersive.
