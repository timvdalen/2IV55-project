\begin{frame}{Bottlenecks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Not really walking
		\item Out-of-world task
	\end{itemize}
	
	\note{
		Math problems are outside of the virtual world, while the tasks we came up with originally were inside the world.
	}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Results}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hard to conclude anything \note{With regards to the main question, readings were all over the place, though most people didn't notice anything.\\}
		\item Nausea seems to occur more for negative gains \note{So when the virtual world turns slower than the real world\\}
		\item So it seems that this is noticed earlier \note{But this part is also not very interesting w.r.t. real-world problems\\}
	\end{itemize}
	\note{We can only do the experiment once for each person, since it would ruin the results otherwise.}
